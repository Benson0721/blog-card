## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned
This is my first time following a mobile-first workflow to complete a project. Changing the logic from desktop-first to mobile-first is a bit of a challenge for me. I also found that my experience with using semantic HTML markup is not sufficient, so I must focus more on this aspect.

### Continued development
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS
### Useful resources

- [https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/responsive-design/] - This helped me understand what is mobile-first workflow. I really liked this website and will use it going forward.
